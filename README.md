# The free press needs you

We're thirty people who love building things in Schibsted’s Next Generation
Products, and we’re building things that make people smarter. We’re pretty big
on democracy, and that only works when everyone knows enough to make good
decisions.

All of Schibsted is working hard on that, and our part is to try, fail and
nail the next generation of publishing products. We’re engineers, designers,
product managers and journalists, and this is what we’re working on right now:

* With _VG Next_, we’re building a newspaper where journalists talk to you, and
  where you can talk back.
* It’s all a matter of perspective, and you’d have to read a dozen newspapers to
  get them all. _Omni_ does that for you.
* With _Sports Next_, we’re building a live sports service for the future, as
  personal and unique as the people who use it.

We need more people to be working on this. We’re looking for engineers whose
code doubles as documentation, and whose commits have us racing to merge just
to be a part of them. We like JavaScript, Swift and Kotlin, but we’re always
excited to try new things, and we hope you are, too!

If that’s you, we’d really like to work with you. You’d play an essential part
in building great things for a good cause, and you’d have an equal say in how we
build them. You’d be part of a tight-knit team that would love to have you on
board, and most importantly: The world really needs you to be doing this right
now.

Read all about us and our openings for [front-end engineers][front-end] and
[back-end engineers][back-end]. We hope to hear from you.
